The socioeconomic and infrastructure data made compatible in statistical grids need to be normalized so that they do not cause damage in the interaction with the other variables of different dimension. Subsequently, the rasterization is performed in a dimension compatible with the crossing of data, for this it is necessary that the information planes are in the same spatial resolution or spatial precision of the generated analyses.
